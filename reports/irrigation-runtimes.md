##  Run Times

Months | City Restrictions | My Approach
-------|-------------------|----------------
Nov thru Mar | Mondays only | 15m/zone if no rain recently
Apr thru May | Mon/Fri only | 15m/zone if no heavy rain recently
Jun thru Aug | Mon/Fri only | 22m/zone
Sep thru Oct | Mon/Fri only | 15m/zone if no heavy rain recently

I tend to prefer multiple run times on a watering day in order to minimize any
runoff. The hard clay soil sometimes makes watering pointless when too moist.
The run times in the table above are cumulative. So 15m/zone may be accomplished
with three run times, 5m/zone, roughly 60-90min apart.

Varies by season, weather conditions, and any adjustments to the local
situation. These figures are for the turf grass and may need to be adjusted
for beds or shrubs. However, only zone 1 is really setup to be a "bed-only" or
"shrub-only" zone. All other zones are installed for the benefit of turf grass.

These figures are also for spray heads. Should a different head (rotary, gear, etc)
be used, the figures should be adjusted for the flow rate of the new head.

These are season values as well, as supplied by the installer. He provided
a baseline figure of 42min, then month ratios of the baseline.
